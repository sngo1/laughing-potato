# Solar System
  Welcome to your very own solar system! This is a solar system simulation, where you will be able to add and remove asteroids, planets, and stars.  We hope you enjoy a peek into an alternate universe...


# Instructions:
1. Run the program. 
2. You will be given a toolbar on the bottom with asteroids, planets, and stars. The buttons will allow you to add an object of your choice, add a random object, or remove an object, labeled accordingly. 
  If you choose to add...
    a. an asteroid, you will be given a radius, speed, and angle. Click anywhere in the solar system to launch your asteroid at the given speed and angle into your solar system.
    b. a star, you can place stars by clicking anywhere in the solar system and they will remain in the background, not affecting the solar system.
    c. a planet, you will be given a planet of a randomized color.
